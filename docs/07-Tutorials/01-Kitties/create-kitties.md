# Part II: Create, view and own Kitties
_This is tutorial steps you through building a fully functional dapp for managing Substrate Kitties._

## Goal

Build an NFT dapp inspired by the original Crypto Kitties dapp on Ethereum.

## Overview

In this first part, you will break things down into components which you will need to build throughout the tutorial.
In doing so, you will learn the basics of setting up a pallet and including basic storage items to run your Substrate node.

Before jumping into the next section, let's have a look at what we'll be doing.

The Kitties tutorial is a step by step guide to build a decentralized application that enables the creation and ownership management
of NFT Kitties. In this implementation, to keep things simple, Kitties really can only do the following things:
- be created either by some original source or by being bred by existing Kitties.
- be sold at a price set by their owner
- be transferred from one owner to another

## Steps

### 1. Create and use the Randomness trait

### 2. Create and use pallet Events

### 3. How to own and issue a Kitty NFT

### 4. How to view owned Kitties
