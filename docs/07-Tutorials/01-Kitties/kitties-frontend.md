# Part V: Kitties front-end
_Build the custom frontend for the Substrate Kitties workshop._

## Learning outcomes

- Connect your chain to the Substrate front-end template
- Customize the template using PolkadotJS API
- Interact with your chain 
## Overview
Now that we have completed runtime development, it is time to build a user interface which can easily access and interact with our 
custom storage items and functions.

Since this course is primarily about runtime development, what you will learn in this section will not be as comprehensive as before, 
however it should empower you with the tools needed to extend your own knowledge and abilities.



## Steps

### 1. Build React components for our functions

### 2. Connect our node to a front-end (custom types)
